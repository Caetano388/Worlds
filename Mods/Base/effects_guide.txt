---- Effects Guide ----

Effects are occurrences that can happen to different types of entities (cells, groups, factions, etc) when an event occurs within the simulation. These can affect the entity in multiple ways depending on the type of effect.

Here's a list of the current types of effects (more to be added in future versions) and how they work:

- 'add_group_knowledge'
    Assigns the specified knowledge to the specified group, and sets the knowledge's level limit to the specified value (integer value between 1 and 10000). the format of the effect is as follows: 'add_group_knowledge:<target_group_type>,<knowledge_id>,<levelLimit>'
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'add_group_knowledge:this,agriculture_knowledge,10', 'add_group_knowledge:this,shipbuilding_knowledge,30'

- 'remove_group_knowledge'
    Removes the specified knowledge from the specified group. the format of the effect is as follows: 'remove_group_knowledge:<target_group_type>,<knowledge_id>'
    NOTE: Try make sure that no more than one 'effector' can remove a particular knowledge at any given time.
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'remove_group_knowledge:this,agriculture_knowledge', 'remove_group_knowledge:this,shipbuilding_knowledge'

- 'modify_group_knowledge_limit'
    Assigns the specified knowledge to the specified group, and modify the knowledge's current level limit by adding the specified value (integer value between -10000 and 10000). the format of the effect is as follows: 'modify_group_knowledge_limit:<target_group_type>,<knowledge_id>,<levelLimitDelta>'
    NOTE: This effect cannot decrease a knowledge level limit below 1 nor it can increase a specific limit above 10000.
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'modify_group_knowledge_limit:this,shipbuilding_knowledge,20', 'modify_group_knowledge_limit:this,shipbuilding_knowledge,-20'

- 'add_group_activity'
    Assigns the specified activity to the specified group. the format of the effect is as follows: 'add_group_activity:<target_group_type>,<activity_id>'
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'add_group_activity:this,farming'

- 'remove_group_activity'
    Removes the specified activity from the specified group. the format of the effect is as follows: 'remove_group_activity:<target_group_type>,<activity_id>'
    NOTE: Try make sure that no more than one 'effector' can remove a particular activity at any given time.
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'remove_group_activity:this,farming'

- 'add_group_property'
    Assigns the specified property to the specified group. the format of the effect is as follows: 'add_group_property:<target_group_type>,<property>'
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'add_group_property:this,CAN_FORM_POLITY:tribe'

- 'remove_group_property'
    Removes the specified property from the specified group. the format of the effect is as follows: 'remove_group_property:<target_group_type>,<property>'
    NOTE: Try make sure that no more than one 'effector' can remove a particular property at any given time.
    These are valid target group types:
    - 'this': the cell group this effect targets

    Examples: 'remove_group_property:this,CAN_FORM_POLITY:tribe'
