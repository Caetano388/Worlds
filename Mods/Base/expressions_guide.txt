---- Expressions Guide ----

Expressions are scripting elements within a mod that are evaluated during the game execution. They can be used to evaluate conditions, set parameters, and modify a game entity behavior through effects.

An expression takes the form of a logical or mathematical statement like the following:

"[unary-operator]exp-element-A [binary-operator exp-element-B]"

The square bracket enclosed elements are optional, and an expression element (or exp-element) can be any of the following:

- a numeric value (1, 3, 5.3442, 0.2332, etc...)
- a boolean value (true, false)
- a string value ("hello world!")
- an entity value (polities, factions, agents, cells, groups, properties, etc...)
- an entity attribute value (example: faction.leader, faction.core_group, polity.get_random_group())
- a function (min(), max(), normalize(), etc...)
- a sub-expression ("1 + 1", "3 * (2 + 1)", etc...)

There are two main types of expressions, VALUE expressions, and EFFECT expressions. Value expressions are expressions that upon being evaluated, return a value of a specific type such as a number, a boolean, a string, or an entity. Effect expressions, when evaluated, do not return anything, but instead, have an effect within the game, such as modifying an entity's attribute value, creating a new entity, or destroying it. More info below.

Expressions assigned to a mod context attribute must be of the appropriate type. For example, an event's assignmentConditions expects a list of expressions that evaluate to boolean values like "2 > 3" or "target.core_group != new_core_group". Likewise, operators can only operate on specific types of expressions. For example, in, the boolean expression "expA >= expB", the operator '>=' expects 'expA' and 'expB' to be numeric expressions.

Function expressions are a type of expression that expects a list of 0 or more parameters. There's only a limited set of valid function expressions. And a list of all of them can be found in function_expressions.txt

-- VALUE TYPES --

Each value expression is expected to return a value of a specific type. Here's a list of each value type and its properties.

- Numeric Values:
  Numeric value expressions are expressions that return a number as a result. This number can be an integer or a decimal value, and the range of values can go from -3.40282347E+38 to 3.40282347E+38. Though the expression system does not support fixed number representations larger than 10 digits. See expression_operators.txt for a list of operators to work with and/or return numeric values.

Entities are a special kind of value that encapsulate in-game entities like polities, factions, agents, cells, groups, etc. Entities have properties that can be accessed using the dot operator '.'.
