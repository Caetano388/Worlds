---- Entities Guide ----

Entities are a special type of value that represent components within the simulation
or components used to encapsulate other components. Entities can have one or more
attributes which can be accessed using the 'access' operator, '.', in the following
manner: <entity>.<attribute>
Example:
  "target.preferences.cohesion"

An access operation is handled as an expression and as such, can either ver resolved
into a value or an effect. A value returned by an access operator can be of any of
the supported types: numbers, booleans, strings or other entities. Certain attributes
refer to functions, and as such, expect one or more parameters to resolve.

Here's a list of currently supported entities and their attributes:

- CELL:
  This type of entity encapsulates a a fixed area on the world map and has general
  information about that area's characteristics: longitude, latitude, altitude, temperature,
  rainfall, present biomes, etc.
  Accessible properties:
  - biome_trait_presence: attribute function that returns the presence of a specific
    biome trait within a cell as a value between 0 and 1.
    Example: "cell.biome_trait_presence(wood)"

- GROUP:
  This type of entity encapsulates a population group occupying a cell on the surface
  of the map and contains information about characteristics like: population, cultural
  attributes, influences, etc.
