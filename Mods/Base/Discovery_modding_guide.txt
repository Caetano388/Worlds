---- Discovery Modding Guide ----

Discovery modding files are located within the 'Discoveries' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

      "name":                       -- (required) Name of discovery

      "gainConditions":             -- (optional) List of all conditions a cell group must meet to gain this discovery, separated by commas (see note #2)
      "holdConditions":             -- (optional) List of all conditions a cell group must meet to hold onto this discovery, separated by commas (see note #2)

    },
