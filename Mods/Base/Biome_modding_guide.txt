---- Biomes Modding guide ----

Biome modding files are located within the 'Biomes' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

-- File Structure --

{
  "biomes": [ -- list of biomes --
    {
      "id":                -- (required) Unique biome identifier, if more than one biome definition share ids, only the last one loaded will be used
      "name":              -- (required) String to be used by the game's UI. Please avoid using overlong strings or non-unicode characters
      "color":             -- (required) HTML color code (#RRGGBB) to use to represent biome on map (transparency values, if added, will be ignored)
      "type":              -- (required) Indicates if the biome is land-based or sea-based (accepted values: "land", "sea")

      "minAltitude":       -- (optional) Minimum cell altitude at which this biome can be present, a value of '0' refers to sea level (meters)
      "maxAltitude":       -- (optional) Maximum cell altitude at which this biome can be present, a value of '0' refers to sea level (meters)
      "minRainfall":       -- (optional) Minimum cell rainfall at which this biome can be present (mm per year)
      "maxRainfall":       -- (optional) Maximum cell rainfall at which this biome can be present (mm per year)
      "minTemperature":    -- (optional) Minimum cell temperature at which this biome can be present (centigrade, yearly average)
      "maxTemperature":    -- (optional) Maximum cell temperature at which this biome can be present (centigrade, yearly average)

      "survivability":     -- (required) Base probability of a given human group surviving in this biome (between 0 and 1 inclusive)
      "foragingCapacity":  -- (required) Base foraging capacity this cell provides to a human group (between 0 and 1 inclusive)
      "accessibility":     -- (required) Base travel modifier in and out this cell (between 0 and 1 inclusive)

      "layerConstraints": [
        {
          "layerId":
          "minValue:"
          "maxValue:"
        }
      ]
    },
    ... -- additional biomes --
  ]
}

-- Notes --
1. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
2. Optional 'min' attribute values (altitude/rainfall/temperature) not defined will be assigned the minimum attribute value of its category
3. Optional 'max' attribute values (altitude/rainfall/temperature) not defined will be assigned the maximum attribute value of its category
