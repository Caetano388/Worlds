---- Factors Guide ----

Factors are properties that can be used to modify other properties like, for example, and event time-to-trigger. Note that factors will always have values between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

- Factor Modifiers -

[SQ] - SQUARE: A factor's effect can squared (i.e. multiply the factor by itself) before being applied to the affected property by using the [SQ] prefix.

[INV] - INVERSE: A factor's effect can be inversed by applying the [INV] prefix so that the affected property becomes inversely proportional (i.e. '[INV]<factor>' equals '1 - <factor>').

Modifiers must be enclosed together with factors within single quotes. Modifiers can be used together using parenthesis to set modifier priority (values between parenthesis evaluate first).
Example: '[SQ]([INV]<factor>)'

Here's a list of the current types of factors (more to be added in future versions) and how they work:

- 'neighborhood_sea_presence'
    Calculates the total amount of sea-type biomes present in the target cell and all neighboring cells surrounding the cell. The factor's value will fall within the range of 0 (no sea presence in the target cell nor any surrounding cell) and 1 (all 9 cells have 100% sea-type biome presence)

    Examples: 'neighborhood_sea_presence', '[INV]neighborhood_sea_presence'
