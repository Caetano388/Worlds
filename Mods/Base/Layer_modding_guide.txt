---- Layer Modding guide ----

Layer modding files are located within the 'Layers' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

-- File Structure --

{
  "layers": [ -- list of layers --
    {
      "id":                      -- (required) Unique layer identifier, if more than one layer definition share ids, only the last one loaded will be used
      "name":                    -- (required) String to be used by the game's UI. Please avoid using overlong strings or non-unicode characters
      "units":                   -- (optional) String to be used to mark the units used to measure this value (preferably no longer than 5 characters)
      "color":                   -- (required) HTML color code (#RRGGBB) to use to display layer on map (transparency values, if added, will be ignored)

      "noiseScale":              -- (required) This affects the size of the layer splotches. Larger values will generate larger splotches (Value between 0.01 and 2)
      "secondaryNoiseInfluence": -- (optional) This substracts lower scale noise of the layer splotches. A value of 0 means no secondary noise influence effect (Value between 0 and 1)
      "maxPossibleValue":        -- (required) What is the maximum possible value this layer can have on a cell (Value between 1 and 1000000)
      "frequency":               -- (required) What is the probability if this layer being present at all on a cell (Value between 0.01 and 1)

      "minAltitude":             -- (optional) Minimum cell altitude at which this layer can be present, a value of '0' refers to sea level (meters)
      "maxAltitude":             -- (optional) Maximum cell altitude at which this layer can be present, a value of '0' refers to sea level (meters)
      "minRainfall":             -- (optional) Minimum cell rainfall at which this layer can be present (mm per year)
      "maxRainfall":             -- (optional) Maximum cell rainfall at which this layer can be present (mm per year)
      "minTemperature":          -- (optional) Minimum cell temperature at which this layer can be present (centigrade, yearly average)
      "maxTemperature":          -- (optional) Maximum cell temperature at which this layer can be present (centigrade, yearly average)
    },
    ... -- additional layers --
  ]
}

-- Notes --
1. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
2. Optional 'min' attribute values (altitude/rainfall/temperature) not defined will be assigned the minimum attribute value of its category
3. Optional 'max' attribute values (altitude/rainfall/temperature) not defined will be assigned the maximum attribute value of its category
