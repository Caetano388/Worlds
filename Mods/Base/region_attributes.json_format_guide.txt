-- Notes --
1. Only one region_attributes.json file can be used per world. If more than one region_attributes.json file is present across multiple active mod files, only the last one being loaded will be used.
2. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
3. At least one variant must be present for each attribute.

  Variant nouns are defined as follow: <noun>({(<relation>):<noun or suffix>})(:<noun or suffix>({...}))...
  Parts enclosed within parenthesis denote optional definition elements. Parts enclosed within brackets indicate that the variant should be decomposed into two variants, one of which omits the enclosed part. The "<relation>" keyword (enclosed in '<' and '>') is used to denote parts that should be filtered when constructing specific types of phrases (mostly used to filter plural nouns).
  Here are some variant examples:
    "glacier{<relation>:s}" - which decomposes into variants "glacier" and "glacier:s"
    "shrub:land{:s}" - which decomposes into variants "shrub:land" and "shrub:land:s"
    "grass:land{:s}" - which decomposes into variants "grass:land" and "grass:land:s"
    "forest{<relation>:s}" - which decomposes into variants "forest" and "forest:s"
    "waste{:land}{:s}" - which decomposes into variants "waste", "waste:s", "waste:land", and "waste:land:s"
  Refer to language_modding_guide.txt for more details on how to define translatable nouns.

4. Each region constraint within the list must be encased within single quotes. These are used to decide whether or not to associate the element with a particular region. Refer to region_constraints_guide.txt for more details on how to define and use region constraints
5. Each phrase association string within the list must be encased in single quotes. These are used to form nouns or noun phrases for procedurally generated proper names and other types of texts. Refer to phrase_association_guide.txt for more details on how to define phrase associations
