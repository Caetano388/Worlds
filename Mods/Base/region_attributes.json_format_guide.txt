-- Notes --
1. Only one region_attributes.json file can be used per world. If more than one region_attributes.json file is present across multiple active mod files, only the last one being loaded will be used.
2. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
3. At least one variant must be present for each attribute.
  Variant nouns are defined as follow: <noun>({(<relation>):<noun or suffix>})(:<noun or suffix>({...}))...
  Parts enclosed within parenthesis denote optional definition elements. Parts enclosed within brackets indicate that the variant should be decomposed into two variants, one of which should omit the enclosed noun. The "<relation>" keyword (enclosed in '<' and '>') is used to denote parts that should be filtered when constructing specific types of phrases (mostly used to filter plural nouns).
  Here are some variant examples:
    "glacier{<relation>:s}" - which decomposes into variants "glacier" and "glacier:s"
    "shrub:land{:s}" - which decomposes into variants "shrub:land" and "shrub:land:s"
    "grass:land{:s}" - which decomposes into variants "grass:land" and "grass:land:s"
    "forest{<relation>:s}" - which decomposes into variants "forest" and "forest:s"
    "waste{:land}{:s}" - which decomposes into variants "waste", "waste:s", "waste:land", and "waste:land:s"
  Refer to language_modding_guide.txt for more details on parseable nouns.
4. Each association string within the list must be encased in single quotes. Associations are used along with the element and one or more adjectives to build composite words or noun phrases. If an association can be used to forma noun phrase it must have at three parts as follows: '<association word>,<relations>,<form>'
    - <association word>: an action noun or attributive verb. Refer to language_modding_guide.txt for more details on using association words
    - <relations>: one or more prepositions (separated by pipes, '|') that can link the association word with the element
    - <forms>: one or more forms (separated by pipes, '|') the element can take as part of the noun phrase. They can be one of the following:
      -- 'ns': name singular. Examples: "the stone", "mount"
      -- 'ds': definite singular. Examples: "the mount", "stone"
      -- 'is': indefinite singular. Examples: "a stone", "an arch"
      -- 'dp': definite plural. Examples: "the stones", "mounts"
      -- 'ip': indefinite plural. Examples: "stones", "archs"
      -- 'u': uncountable. Examples: "water", "air"
  Example association strings that can be used to form noun phrases:
    '[nrv]throw:er,of,ip|ns'
    '[iv(bear,ts,past)]born,between,ip'
    '[nrv]break:er,of,ip|ns'
    '[iv(bear,ts,past)]born,under,ns'
    '[nrv]cut:ter,of,u'
  Associations can also be used exclusively to form composite words. In such cases, only the '<association word>'
  Example association strings that can be used to only form composite words:
    '[ran]work:er'
    '[ran]dance:r'
