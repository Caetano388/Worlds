BUGS:

- (HIGH 1/18/18) Decision dialog overlaps with other modal dialogs (see screenshot bugs\bug_overlap.png)
- (HIGH 1/18/18) Overlay subtype dialog remains open when guiding faction (see screenshot bugs\bug_overlap.png)
- (HIGH 1/19/18) Invalid input when trying to generate new world (tries custom world by default, maybe just when tested within editor)
- (MED 1/17/18) Regions seems to get selected when clicking on polity overlays
- (MED 1/17/18) Clicking on regions do not highlight them rightaway until clicked a second time
- (MED 1/18/18) Check why certain cells get updated very frequently afer the world mostly stabilized
- (LOW 1/18/18) Sometimes factions appear with exactly the same name (possibly due to both factions having the same core?)
- (LOW 2/19/18) Expanding polity inflence effects should be calculated on their own phase (outside of the event) to reduce load discrepancies
