BUGS:
Cleanup rules: Prioritize bugs first by rating bucket (HIGH,MED,LOW) then within each bucket by date from older to newer. When finishing up with all HIGHs, graduate the oldest MED to HIGH and the three oldest LOWs to MEDs then re-sort the MEDs by date.

- (HIGH 3/18/18) When a player guided faction creates or joins a new tribe it should change selection and guidance focus
- (HIGH 3/25/18) A Faction's authority preference resets to previous values after a while for no apparent reason
- (MED 1/17/18) Regions seems to get selected when clicking on polity overlays
- (MED 1/17/18) Clicking on regions do not highlight them right away until clicked a second time
- (MED 1/18/18) Check why certain cells get updated very frequently afer the world mostly stabilized
- (LOW 1/18/18) Sometimes factions appear with exactly the same name (possibly due to both factions having the same core?)
- (LOW 2/19/18) Expanding polity inflence effects should be calculated on their own phase (outside of the event) to reduce load 
- (LOW 3/25/18) Check capitalization in the panel for focused tribes
- (LOW 3/25/18) Check capitalization and word order for polity names in the infopanel
- (LOW 3/25/18) Check capitalization and word order int panel for guided faction

TASKS:

- a faction that losses too much prominence should dissapear
- a decision message should be displayed (or popup) when the dominant faction of a followed polity changes
- show specific cultural attribute values for factions in tooltips
- customize decision dialogs to show why it might fail or succeed depending on faction and leader attributes
- make test builds for patreons
- add decent schedule, progress path and a feature wish list
- add a wave influence transfer event that triggers after short spans on neighborging cells that have lower influence
- add world customization templates
- allow replacement of populations
- Rewind, go back in time
- Ability to have multiple Overlays at a time
- Resoultion options
- Log of the world's history

EXTRA:

- Don't create MigrationGroup objects on every migration



Future developments:

Artisanship - activity
Metalurgy - knowledge

Types of factions
Clans - migratory (core should be centroid of territory), nebulous, no focus
Families - core within an urban area, associated with a trade
Houses - noble status (caste), associated with a territory, core is capital of territory

Low cohesiveness should reduce polity influence within cellgroups.
