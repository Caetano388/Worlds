BUGS:

- (HIGH 3/4/18) Trying to prevent a clan from splitting doesn't seem to reduce authority
- (MED 1/17/18) Regions seems to get selected when clicking on polity overlays
- (MED 1/17/18) Clicking on regions do not highlight them rightaway until clicked a second time
- (MED 1/18/18) Check why certain cells get updated very frequently afer the world mostly stabilized
- (LOW 1/18/18) Sometimes factions appear with exactly the same name (possibly due to both factions having the same core?)
- (LOW 2/19/18) Expanding polity inflence effects should be calculated on their own phase (outside of the event) to reduce load discrepancies
