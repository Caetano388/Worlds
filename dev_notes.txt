BUGS:
Cleanup rules: Prioritize bugs first by rating bucket (HIGH,MED,LOW) then within each bucket by date from older to newer. When finishing up with all HIGHs, graduate the oldest MED to HIGH and the three oldest LOWs to MEDs then re-sort the MEDs by date.

<<<Insert all new bugs, issues and tasks in Worlds' Github DB>>>

- (LOW 1/18/18) Sometimes factions appear with exactly the same name (possibly due to both factions having the same core?)
- (LOW 2/19/18) Expanding polity influence effects should be calculated on their own phase (outside of the event) to reduce load 
- (LOW 3/25/18) Check capitalization in the panel for focused tribes
- (LOW 3/25/18) Check capitalization and word order for polity names in the infopanel
- (LOW 3/25/18) Check capitalization and word order in panel for guided faction
- (LOW 3/27/18) When a faction property changes after a decision, if the simulation is paused, the change doesn't reflect on the polity.

TASKS:

- a faction that losses too much prominence should disappear
- a decision message should be displayed (or popup) when the dominant faction of a followed polity changes
- show specific cultural attribute values for factions in tooltips
- customize decision dialogs to show why it might fail or succeed depending on faction and leader attributes
- make test builds for patreons
- add decent schedule, progress path and a feature wish list
- add a wave influence transfer event that triggers after short spans on neighboring cells that have lower influence
- add world customization templates
- allow replacement of populations
- Rewind, go back in time
- Ability to have multiple Overlays at a time
- Resolution options
- Log of the world's history

EXTRA:

- Don't create MigrationGroup objects on every migration

Future developments:

Artisanship - activity
Metallurgy - knowledge

Types of factions
Clans - migratory (core should be centroid of territory), nebulous, no focus
Families - core within an urban area, associated with a trade
Houses - noble status (caste), associated with a territory, core is capital of territory

Low cohesiveness should reduce polity influence within cellgroups.
