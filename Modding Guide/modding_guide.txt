-- Creating a new mod for Worlds - History Simulator --

The first step to create a a new mod is to create a folder within the 'Mods' folder. The folder's name will be considered the mod's name within the game, and there's no restriction for how a mod should be named as long as it is a valid folder name.

Each mod root folder must contain a 'version.json' file that defines the earliest game version the mod is intended for. Please read the "mod_version_guide.txt" for more details on how to write a version file for your mod.

If the game fails to find a 'version.json' file, then it will assume the mod is intended for 'Worlds' version 0.3.3, which is the earliest game version to support mods.

Additionally, a mod must contain at least one component folder containing mod definition files. Depending the type of mod file, each file must be placed within any of the following component folders.

- Adjectives
- Biomes
- Decisions
- Discoveries
- Elements
- Events
- Layers
- RegionAttributes

Each folder can contain one or more JSON definition files. These files can have any name as long as they have the .json extension. Although it is important is that they follow the definition structure required by the type of mod, and that they are located in the correct folder. If a specific folder would not have any files on it, then the folder doesn't need to be present within the mod.

The game can load more than one mod at a time. It will load them in alphabetical order. So make sure that mods that are dependent on other mods are loaded in the correct order.

Here's a quick preview of each supported mod component:
